## Accepted carry-forward

The seed contributes deterministic synthetic fixtures, immutable artifact and
receipt concepts, revision-aware normalized facts, coverage periods,
deterministic reconciliation exceptions, bounded lineage, native object/view
definitions, standalone navigation, and native graph configuration.

The dashboard presentation is redesigned against the canonical Twenty UI
package and theme. The complete path classification is in [PORTING.md](./PORTING.md).

## Explicit exclusions

This Phase A App contains no:

- real Hass record, account number, credential, token, or provider request;
- Clover OAuth configuration, client secret, connection provider, tool, or
  role-based provider authority;
- deployed Workspace state, installation, user invitation, production setting,
  Cloudflare mutation, or live dashboard claim.

The only Clover-shaped entries are clearly synthetic fixture rows used to test
POS overlap and reconciliation semantics.

## Verification scope

Fixture generation, behavioral unit tests, lint, App manifest build, and
typecheck are source evidence. The Phase A fixture adapter intentionally has a
fail-closed synthetic Workspace/role selection contract, but it does not prove
runtime authorization. A mounted Workspace preview, server role and
cross-workspace enforcement, client installation, and any real data remain
separate Phase B gates.
