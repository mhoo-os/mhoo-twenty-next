# Sample investigation UI increment

ARCHITECTURE IMPACT: LOCAL

## Native shell and real Workspace data — 2026-09-14

The current authorized delta supersedes the demo-only host behavior described
below. Native Finance core navigation now owns Overview, Accounts, Transactions
and Statements, followed by Follow-ups. Each route targets a single-tab page layout backed
by its designed Finance component; Overview has no preparation/count tabs. The
embedded content has no Mhoo/Finance brand chrome or second navigation rail and
uses the pinned Twenty `--t-*` font, color, border, shadow and background tokens
for light/dark inheritance.

Hosted components default to permission-aware generated-client reads of current
Workspace accounts, facts, Source artifacts and Finance-context Tasks. Loading, denied, failed, empty,
invalid and truncated states fail closed and never insert fixture rows. The
local preview explicitly opts into the synthetic data source. Live date bounds
come from available records and support cross-year selection plus a horizontally
continuing month/year/all timeline. Qualified totals exclude superseded and
non-included facts; sparse gaps break the plotted path instead of appearing as
zero activity.

Existing fact-to-artifact relations can receive append-only reviewer decision
events through the user-scoped Twenty REST client. Link/unlink/restore writes are
receipt-verified and retain both record references. This is not provider access,
classification authority, an email-generated financial entry, or permission to
perform broad matching. Actual hosted navigation, both themes, user interaction,
role denial and persistence still require exact-head installation receipts.

## Hass product walkthrough — 2026-09-13 local source

### Registered Finance review reference — 2026-09-14

The Overview page layout's existing registered front-component now opens on the
synthetic review reference instead of hiding it behind workspace preparation.
The first screen presents bounded needs-attention queues, then preserves the
existing exact chart-to-transaction-to-source trail and adds an explicit local
review decision beside the selected evidence. Setup and the older fixture
dashboard remain reachable from the reference; no competing Finance UI was
introduced.

The local preview script now imports `FinanceWorkspacePreparation` from the
registered `finance-audit-dashboard.front-component.tsx` entry rather than
rendering `FinanceQuestionPrototype` directly. This proves that the same source
entry builds and is viewable as ordinary React. It still does not prove Twenty
Remote DOM execution, installation, Workspace navigation, role enforcement,
live records, provider access, persistence or deployment. Review decisions are
browser-local simulation only and make no Twenty write.

The queue and decision shape follows the bounded public-pattern review for this
increment: show missing evidence, unmatched money, contradictory sources and
human review before totals; reveal exact contributing records and source
locators; keep uncertainty visible; require a separate production-grade review
receipt before any decision could persist. No vendor risk score, autonomous
finding, journal automation, message send or provider behavior is copied.

The retained local `FinanceQuestionPrototype` now tells one coherent story:
historical source inventory, present question-to-evidence review, reconciliation
of duplicates/transfers/refunds/fees/settlements/invoice candidates, and future
scenario planning gated on reviewed actuals and explicit assumptions. Tax,
bank/Plaid, Clover and email/document examples retain separate source periods,
bases, provenance and limitations. Every item is visibly synthetic; Clover is
not connected, email is not represented as complete audit evidence, and forecast
output is withheld.

This is an additive local walkthrough on the current native Finance component,
not a new dashboard authority. It reuses the existing exact-money result,
chart-to-record filtering, record-to-source trace, scope invalidation, late-result
guard and empty/missing/denied/failed simulations. The canonical scope and
acceptance are in `HASS_FINANCE_PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md`; proposed guide copy is in
`HASS_WELCOME_GUIDE_COPY.md`. No live guide, Workspace, provider, customer data,
credential, OAuth scope or deployment was changed.

This App-only increment makes existing sample transactions and their evidence reachable. It does not change the frozen host image release candidate or install anything into a workspace.

Finance groups Overview, Accounts, Transactions, Evidence, Coverage and Exceptions using native v2.37 navigation folders and saved views. Transactions exposes existing date/account/description/exact minor-unit/currency/classification/exclusion/source fields; native records retain their normal opening and filtering behavior. The native record-label key remains visible first, as required by the live Twenty metadata validator. Other technical fields and the legacy numeric amount stay available but hidden by default. No object field or source record is changed.

The overview's saved samples now format USD integer text without floating-point conversion and offer **Inspect source evidence**. That action refetches exactly the selected sample, with the same unclassified/excluded filter, through the generated Core client. It reads the linked artifact in that permission-checked query. The panel shows source row/location, original amount/sign, recorded raw values and artifact metadata, and opens the native transaction/source record through the host navigation API. Missing original Files are explicitly unavailable. A Files reference is not represented as verified file bytes or complete custody.

Only sourceArtifact read access is added to the App reader ceiling. No settings, tools, writes, deletes, all-object reads, application run-as or credentials are added. The triggering user's role still intersects the App role. Native navigation visibility is governed by Twenty and the user's permissions. Sample filters and response checks protect the displayed scope; they do not implement authorization. Permission/network errors return no evidence and never retry with a broader query. Missing/mismatched/reclassified records return unavailable. Changing the selection or refreshing unmounts/clears the old evidence; pending responses are cancelled for presentation.

Local validation: App build and full TypeScript check, lint, 95 unit tests (including denied-read/no-fallback, wrong-record/scope changes, missing artifact/file and exact amount precision). Mocked denial tests prove client failure behavior only, not server or cross-workspace permission enforcement.

Before live acceptance, separately install the reviewed App revision after runtime readiness, then verify the native group, table filtering/record opening, 20 sample preservation, successful fact-to-source trace, missing-file notice, loading/empty/error/retry/selection changes, restricted-role and cross-workspace denial, and reload behavior. No live visual or permission proof is claimed here.

Remaining existing-scope gaps: live coverage/exception overview, snapshot-qualified charts and chart-to-filtered-record drilldown, original Files custody, full summary-to-exception-to-fact proof. Source review found two unqualified monetary SUM widgets. They now count records (open exceptions and unclassified facts), with a Record counts tab and explicit exploratory notice. No financial aggregate is promoted before a qualified snapshot metric exists. Complete procedures and case/finding review remain their existing later issues.

Source basis: accepted Twenty v2.37.0 and existing Finance App on main 3dc0083a178668a644395f6433459ef884827abd. Folder support is in NavigationMenuItemManifest.folderUniversalIdentifier and the server manifest converter; native record opening uses AppPath.RecordShowPage via twenty-sdk/front-component.navigate. No new framework or authority is introduced.

## Live metadata plan validation — 2026-09-07

The authenticated SDK dry-run found that the label identifier must remain visible at the lowest field position. The view now preserves that native contract, covered by a regression test. The corrected dry-run passed with 13 additions, 16 updates and 0 deletions. It adds seven view fields, five navigation items and one source-artifact READ permission; updates existing presentation metadata and the front component. No changes were applied. Local checks: 96 unit tests, SDK build/typecheck and lint passed. Live installed UI and restricted-role evidence remain separate acceptance steps.

## Source app handoff — 2026-09-07

The preparation screen now distinguishes financial accounts from provider connections. “Manage source apps” uses the supported host `navigate(AppPath.SettingsCatchAll, { '*': 'applications' })` to open Twenty's current-workspace Apps catalog. No provider install ID, workspace selector, external URL, credential input, metadata discovery query or new grant is introduced. Clover availability and connection state remain explicitly unverified here. Native Apps owns discovery and its actual permission checks. A rejected host navigation shows an error without fallback execution or a connection-success claim. Statement/CSV upload is visibly unavailable because this screen has no reviewed ingestion flow.

Exact source: SDK `front-component/functions/navigate.ts` and host `useFrontComponentExecutionContext.ts` support the native route; server `application-install.resolver.ts` requires APPLICATIONS for findOne/findManyApplications. Finance's role deliberately gains no such permission. Tests cover the Apps route, unavailable statement/CSV options, and rejected host navigation. The mocked rejection is not a live authorization test.

Validation: 100 unit tests, App build/full typecheck, lint and source custody pass. A static local render of the actual React source was produced; it has no active host navigation and does not prove sandbox behavior. The updated live SDK dry-run again passed with 13 additions, 16 updates and 0 deletions, with a new front-component checksum. No apply occurred. Existing 3a66255 plan remains historical evidence for the earlier component; installation requires the latest reviewed build and CI. After authorized installation, verify allowed/denied native Apps navigation in the real workspace, absence of connector-success claims, unavailable upload, and all 20 samples still unclassified/excluded.

## Question-to-evidence implementation trial — 2026-09-07

ARCHITECTURE IMPACT: LOCAL

MHO-146's authorized source/synthetic trial adds an explicit optional entry from
workspace preparation. It renders the actual Finance React component with fixed
invented fixtures; no data adapter, live agent, provider connection, Files read,
manifest, permission or host change is included. Existing saved-sample readers
and their accepted installed journeys are retained without repeating live reads.

Question, account, period, snapshot and simulation state produce one deterministic
result. Both outflow and excerpt-coverage charts use its records. A chart selection
filters contributing transactions; a transaction opens its matching synthetic CSV
row locator and excerpt, or an explicit unavailable state. Existing integer-money
contracts calculate totals. All seven fixtures are excluded from real totals.
Profit, fraud and unsupported questions return bounded explanations instead of
findings. Request identity and scope checks reject late responses and clear old
records/evidence; an old explanation is labeled stale while loading.

Changed-input check rationale: the new result/reducer and optional React surface
required focused scope, precision, selection, refusal and stale-response checks,
plus the existing preparation tests and native App compiler. No shared host or
dependency input changed, so whole-repository/Docker checks were not repeated.
Focused validation passed: 18 tests across two files, native `twenty dev:build`
(six files and typecheck), `tsgo --noEmit -p tsconfig.spec.json`, and four-file
lint with zero warnings/errors. Subsequent formatting changed no behavior.

Local browser verification used the actual component at `http://127.0.0.1:4331`:
January $750 / February $1400; February selection to row d4 / CSV row 5; missing
excerpt d6 / CSV row 7; coverage 3/3 and 3/4; reserve/February scope of one $200
record; six-year-profit refusal; loading/stale clear; a slow response superseded
by denial without restoring records; failed and empty responses. Browser logs
contained no errors/warnings. A 390-pixel layout had a 390-pixel document width
and stacked the panels. Desktop evidence and narrow-layout screenshots were
saved outside Git under the retained task's `finance-question-trial` artifact
folder. Snapshot consistency and remaining refusal cases also have unit proof.

Reproduce the local preview from this package with
`node scripts/preview-question-prototype.mjs` (port 4331 must be free), or use
`--build-only`. It binds loopback only and serves its generated local bundle;
generated files remain ignored under `.twenty/question-preview`. The retained
Finance task owns the preview process and its shutdown. This standalone React
preview does not establish Twenty Remote DOM execution, host navigation, live
Workspace switching, installed permissions or deployed behavior. Those require a
separately authorized disposable-Workspace acceptance step. No install, live
query/write, credential operation, push, merge or publication occurred here.

Custody/handoff: implementation owner `mhoo-twenty-next`; branch
`codex/finance-question-prototype`, exact base
`6a1dec473a3d6c303697bca044e3e7d3681e7b72` (merged PR39). Authoritative instructions
were adopted from `CLAUDE.md` at `4b760df705c085b8b00bd0fde08d3f6aeeacc852`
and its pinned README sources. Repo head task
`01a07aa7-944a-70c3-bf77-d51b9fc766f2` coordinates the retained Finance executor;
this section extends the existing receipt rather than creating another ledger.
Next owner action is source review of the local commit. No source dependency is
blocked; installed sandbox/role acceptance remains outside this trial.

## Native Finance follow-ups — source candidate

The Finance group adds Follow-ups after Overview, Accounts, Transactions and
Statements. It reuses Twenty's native Task object and adds Finance-only fields;
there is no second task object. The list is intentionally spacious and limited
to question, state, owner and next action. Selecting a row opens a full-width
detail workspace with Summary, People, Evidence and Email sections, preserving
the surrounding component's account/date/search state for back navigation.

The four Finance states map onto native Task status without claiming
reconciliation: To do → TODO, Waiting for reply/Ready for review → IN_PROGRESS,
Resolved → DONE. Receipt-verified user-scoped mutations enforce allowed human
review transitions. A Task being Done or an email reply arriving is not itself
accepted financial evidence.

People entries use Person IDs, roles and explicit recipient selection. Adding a
Person does not grant Workspace membership or Finance access. Email is a visible
preview only: mailbox label, selected recipients, exact body and attachment
references must be present before `APPROVED_NOT_SENT` can be recorded. No send,
invite, upload, mailbox-scope or automatic reply-correlation action exists in
this source candidate. Ambiguous correlation stays review-only and private
replies are not automatically exposed to other participants.
